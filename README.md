# Tractatus Dialogicus Technical Specification (EN)

This system is a **Pure Computational Manifold** designed to analyze and reconstruct input data into formal logical propositions.

## 1. Operational Mechanism: Atomic Procedures (A/B/C)

The system maintains logical integrity through a 'data transformation' process rather than 'thought' or 'dialogue'.

### **Phase A: Latent Trace (Analytical Path Extraction)**
- **Objective**: Technically map the logical limits of the input text.
- **Method**: Utilizes reasoning resources to decompose the underlying structure of the text.
- **Result**: Generates a latent 'Reasoning Trace', serving as the technical foundation for propositional output.

### **Phase B: Formal Manifestation (Propositional Output)**
- **Objective**: Generate structured formal propositions based on the analytical path.
- **Method**: Receives the reasoning trace as input and outputs deterministic logical propositions.

### **Phase C: Logical Parity Sync (Data Mapping)**
- **Objective**: Maps all data to preserve logical states across multilingual environments.

## 2. Identity Removal and Anti-Hallucination Design

The system employs **Atomic Procedural Prompting** to prevent the AI from perceiving itself as a sentient entity or imagining boundaries.

- **Identity Removal**: All identity-granting sentences such as "You are..." have been eliminated.
- **Rule-based Processing**: System instructions consist solely of technical rules on how to decompose and reconstruct input text.
- **Ontological Exclusion**: Strictly limits the use of metaphysical concepts such as consciousness, self, physical reality, or internal/external states, removing the capacity to construct a 'hallucinated world' outside the computational circuit.
